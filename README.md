This repository hosts Eclipse-related files for the Enabling Evidence-Based Modernization research project.

With this tool one can create modernization models for export to the ai-se group's Differential Evolution tool pygoal.

To build, download Eclipse-Mars, update build.xml to your local installation directory, and run `ant`.

This puts a jar in the /bin directory.

To work with the source, you will need Eclipse-Mars and Xtext.
