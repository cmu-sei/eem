	Abstract = { Purpose -- Customization is a difficult task for many organizations implementing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. The purpose of this paper is to develop a new framework based on customers' requirements to examine the ERP customization choices for the enterprise. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) technique has been applied complementarily with this framework to prioritize ERP customization choices. Design/methodology/approach -- Based on empirical literature, the paper proposed an ERP customization framework anchored on the customer's requirements. A case study research method was used to evaluate the applicability of the framework in a real-life setting. In a case study with 15 practitioners working on the vendor's and the client's sides in an ERP implementation, the paper applied the framework jointly with the AHP technique to prioritize the feasible customization choices for ERP implementation. Findings -- The paper demonstrates the applicability of the framework in identifying the various feasible choices for the client organization to consider when they decide to customize their selected ERP product. Research limitations/implications -- Further case studies need to be carried out in various contexts to acquire knowledge about the generalizability of the observations. This will also contribute to refining the proposed ERP customization framework. Practical implications -- Very few literature sources suggest methods for exploring and evaluating customization options in ERP projects from requirements engineering perspective. The proposed framework helps practitioners and consultants anchor the customization decisions on the customer's requirements and use a well-established prioritization technique, AHP, to identify the feasible customization choices for the implementing enterprise. Originality/value -- No previously published research studies provide an approach to prioritize customization choices for ERP anchored on the customer's requirements. },

	Abstract = {Databases are considered to be a valuable asset for organizations because they contain all those organizations' persistent pieces of data. Both databases and the information systems that use them undergo erosion as a consequence of uncontrolled maintenance over time. However, when information systems evolve to become modernized versions of them, existing databases must not be discarded because they contain much valuable business knowledge that is not present anywhere else. Some of the software industry's current demands, such as time-to-market developments and the provision of software as services entail additional challenges in the reuse of legacy systems during software modernization. This paper addresses this problem and proposes a reengineering process that follows model-driven development principles to recover Web services from legacy databases. The Web services that are mined manage access to legacy databases without discarding them. Legacy databases can thus be used by modernized information systems in service-oriented environments. The adoption of this process is facilitated by the implementation of a support tool, which is used to conduct an industrial case study involving a real-life legacy database. The study demonstrates that the proposal reduces development efforts and improves the return of investment by extending the lifespan of legacy databases.

	Abstract = {As cloud computing allows improving the quality of software and aims at reducing costs of operating software, more and more software is delivered as a service. However, moving from a software as a product strategy to delivering software as a service hosted in cloud environments is very ambitious. This is due to the fact that managing software modernization is still a major challenge, especially when paradigm shifts, such as moving to cloud environments, are targeted that imply fundamental changes to how software is modernized, delivered, and sold. Thus, in addition to technical aspects, business aspects need also to be considered. ARTIST proposes a comprehensive software modernization approach covering business and technical aspects. In particular, ARTIST employs Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques to automate the reverse engineering of legacy software and forward engineering of cloud-based software in a way that modernized software truly benefits from targeted cloud environments. Therewith, ARTIST aims at reducing the risks, time, and costs of software modernization and lowers the barriers to exploit cloud computing capabilities and new business models.},

	Abstract = {Context The order in which requirements are implemented affects the delivery of value to the end-user, but it also depends on technical constraints and resource availability. The outcome of requirements prioritization is a total ordering of requirements that best accommodates the various kinds of constraints and priorities. During requirements prioritization, some decisions on the relative importance of requirements or the feasibility of a given implementation order must necessarily resort to a human (e.g., the requirements analyst), possessing the involved knowledge. Objective In this paper, we propose an Interactive Genetic Algorithm (IGA) that includes incremental knowledge acquisition and combines it with the existing constraints, such as dependencies and priorities. We also assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. Method The validation of \{IGA\} was conducted on a real case study, by comparing the proposed algorithm with the state of the art, interactive prioritization technique Incomplete Analytic Hierarchy Process (IAHP). Results The proposed method outperforms \{IAHP\} in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and robustness to decision maker errors. Conclusion \{IGA\} produces a good approximation of the reference requirements ranking, requiring an acceptable manual effort and tolerating a reasonable human error rate. },

	Abstract = {The Incremental Commitment Model (ICM) is a risk-driven process model generator for which common risk patterns generate common special-case system definition and development process models. The increasing importance of Brownfield (legacy- constrained) vs. Greenfield (unconstrained) application systems created a challenge of determining an ICM Brownfield risk pattern and an associated set of special-case process guidelines. This paper presents a case study of a failed Brownfield project, and shows how the concurrent-engineering activities, risk assessments, and anchor point milestones of the ICM could have avoided the failure. It compares the resulting ICM special-case Brownfield process with two leading Brownfield approaches, the CMU-SEI SMART approach and the IBM Brownfield approach, and finds them compatible and complementary.},

	Abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) help software engineers find novel solutions to complex problems. When automatic tools explore too many options, they are slow to use and hard to comprehend. GALE is a near-linear time MOEA that builds a piecewise approximation to the surface of best solutions along the Pareto frontier. For each piece, GALE mutates solutions towards the better end. In numerous case studies, GALE finds comparable solutions to standard methods (NSGA-II, SPEA2) using far fewer evaluations (e.g. 20 evaluations, not 1000). GALE is recommended when a model is expensive to evaluate, or when some audience needs to browse and understand how an MOEA has made its conclusions.},

	Abstract = {Software design is a process of trading off competing objectives. If the user objective space is rich, then we should use optimizers that can fully exploit that richness. For example, this study configures software product lines (expressed as feature maps) using various search-based software engineering methods. As we increase the number of optimization objectives, we find that methods in widespread use (e.g. NSGA-II, SPEA2) perform much worse than IBEA (Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm). IBEA works best since it makes most use of user preference knowledge. Hence it does better on the standard measures (hypervolume and spread) but it also generates far more products with 0% violations of domain constraints. Our conclusion is that we need to change our methods for search-based software engineering, particularly when studying complex decision spaces.},

	Abstract = {The selection of an architecture is a key step in complex system development and has major, often irreversible effects on the performance, cost, and flexibility of the system. In addition to being a process heavily influenced by the technical performance and cost analysis of each individual architecture, the selection of the initial architecture is also determined by less quantifiable criteria such as architecture flexibility and extensibility. In this paper we study methods to analyze initial architecture decisions influenced by these two factors using a fully enumerated tradespace of architectures for the in-space transportation infrastructure for human exploration of Mars. Our approach is to transform this tradespace into a weighted graph with nodes corresponding to architecture-technology combinations and edges corresponding to the ability to transition between two architectures. We restate the problem of selecting an initial architecture as two simple problems on this graph, finding that this approach can determine a small set of non-dominated options useful to the architecture selection process.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The choice of architecture in the design of large-scale complex systems has an enormous bearing on the cost, performance and adaptability of the system. It is often the case that the operational environment of the system changes over time, necessitating evolution of the architecture. In this paper, tradespace graphs of candidate space-based relay networks for NASA's Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) program, focusing on the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) system, are analyzed in order to examine the potential pathways through the tradespace for a specified planning horizon. We utilize a method that enumerates architectures as vertices in a tradespace graph, taking into account both the fixed properties of the architecture and the variable ages of its assets. We then examine what real options can be put in place to enable future flexibility given uncertainty about the lifespan of existing \{TDRS\} assets. In a separate set of analysis, these time-expanded graphs are used to price the potential inclusion of hosted payloads against a range of possible architectural decisions. },

	Abstract = {This paper discusses how preference information of the decision maker can in general be integrated into multiobjective search. The main idea is to first define the optimization goal in terms of a binary performance measure (indicator) and then to directly use this measure in the selection process. To this end, we propose a general indicator-based evolutionary algorithm (IBEA) that can be combined with arbitrary indicators. In contrast to existing algorithms, IBEA can be adapted to the preferences of the user and moreover does not require any additional diversity preservation mechanism such as fitness sharing to be used. It is shown on several continuous and discrete benchmark problems that IBEA can substantially improve on the results generated by two popular algorithms, namely NSGA-II and SPEA2, with respect to different performance measures.},

	Abstract = {To sustain the qualities of a software system during evolution, and to adapt the quality attributes as the requirements evolve, it is necessary to have a clear software architecture that is understood by all developers and to which all changes to the system adheres. This software architecture can be created beforehand, but must also be updated as the domain of the software, and hence the requirements on the software system evolve. Creating a software architecture for a system or part of a system so that the architecture fulfils the desired quality requirements is often hard. In this paper we propose a decision-support method to aid in the understanding of different architecture candidates for a software system. We propose a method that is adaptable with respect to both the set of potential architecture candidates and quality attributes relevant for the system's domain to help in this task. The method creates a support framework, using a multi-criteria decision method, supporting comparison of different software architecture candidates for a specific software quality attribute and vice versa, and then uses this support framework to reach a consensus on the benefits and liabilities of the different software architecture candidates and to increase the confidence in the resulting architecture decision.

	Abstract = {Architecting distributed software applications is a complex design activity. It involves making decisions about a number of inter-dependent design choices that relate to a range of design concerns. Each decision requires selecting among a number of alternatives; each of which impacts differently on various quality attributes. Additionally, there are usually a number of stakeholders participating in the decision-making process with different, often conflicting, quality goals, and project constraints, such as cost and schedule. To facilitate the architectural design process, we propose a quantitative quality-driven approach that attempts to find the best possible fit between conflicting stakeholders' quality goals, competing architectural concerns, and project constraints. The approach uses optimization techniques to recommend the optimal candidate architecture. Applicability of the proposed approach is assessed using a real system.},

	Abstract = {ACAT IA programs are Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS). A MAIS is a DoD acquisition program for an automated information system (AIS) that is either designated by the MDA as a MAIS, or estimated to exceed:
$40 million (FY 2014 constant dollars), for all increments, regardless of appropriation or fund source, directly related to the AIS definition, design, development, and deployment, and incurred in any single FY; or
$165 million (FY 2014 constant dollars), for all expenditures, for all increments,-regardless of appropriation or fund source, directly related to the AIS definition, design, development, and deployment, and incurred from the beginning of the Materiel Solution Analysis (MSA) Phase through deployment at all sites; or
$520 million (FY 2014 constant dollars) for all expenditures, for all increments, regardless of appropriation or fund source, directly related to the AIS definition, design, development, deployment, operations and maintenance (O&M), and incurred from the beginning of the MSA phase through sustainment for the estimated useful life of the -system.
        AIS do not include computer resources, both hardware and software, that are an integral part of a weapon or weapon system; used for highly sensitive classified programs (as determined by the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF)); used for other highly sensitive information technology (IT) programs (as determined by the Department of Defense Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO)); or determined by the USD(AT&L) or designee to be better overseen as a non-AIS program.  

        ACAT IA programs have two sub-categories:
ACAT IAM for which the MDA is the USD(AT&L). The USD(AT&L) may delegate MDA authority to the DoD CIO, or other designee. The ``M'' (in ACAT IAM) refers to MAIS.
ACAT IAC which the MDA (USD(AT&L), DoD CIO, or other designee) has delegated to the head of the DoD component or, if delegated, the CAE. The ``C'' (in ACAT IAC) refers to component.},

	Abstract = {Architecture evolution is a central feature of virtually all software systems. As new market opportuni- ties, technologies, platforms, and frameworks become available systems must change their organiza- tional structures to accommodate them, requiring large-scale and systematic restructuring. Today arc- hitects have few tools to help them plan and execute such evolutionary paths. In particular, they have almost no assistance in reasoning about questions such as: How should we stage the evolution to achieve business goals in the presence of limited development resources? How can we reduce risk in incorporating new technologies and infrastructure required by the target architecture? How can we make principled tradeoffs between time and development effort? What kinds of changes can be made independently, and which require coordinated system-wide modifications? How can an evolution plan be represented and communicated within an organization? In this report we outline first steps towards a formal basis for assisting architects in developing and reasoning about architectural evolution paths. The key insight behind the approach is that at an architectural level of abstraction many system evolu- tions follow certain common patterns -- or evolution styles. By taking advantage of regularity in the space of common architectural evolutions, and by making the notion of evolutions styles a first-class entity that can be formally defined, we can provide automated assistance for expressing architecture evolution, and for reasoning about both the correctness and quality of evolution paths.

	Abstract = {With increasingly complex logistics information technology and dynamic logistics operations in a global setting, today′s logistics managers confront an overwhelming number of decision alternatives. Perhaps the most effective way of evaluating such a large number of alternatives is to utilize advanced information technologies. These technologies encompass decision support systems (DSS), artificial intelligence (AI), expert systems (ES), electronic data interchange (EDI), and barcoding. Since the performance of these technologies is greatly influenced by their supporting software, their success often hinges on the selection of proper software packages. In selecting proper logistics software, an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed which can effectively deal with both qualitative and quantitative factors in multiple‐criteria decision environments. },

	Abstract = {This article highlights the ambiguity inherent in the term 'weight'. The examples have demonstrated an apparent anomaly in Saaty's method if one interprets weight in the sense of multi-attribute utility methods. This can easily be overcome by a modified normalisation procedure, together with a redefined question to make the pairwise comparisons of attributes. In general, real life decision problems are not of the carefully constructed nature of our examples. Thus. for the analyst to be able to interpret the information provided by the decision-maker in a sensible way, it is important that the pairwise comparison questions are more specific than those advocated by Saaty at present. The decision-maker should be clear about, and the analyst aware of. the factors taken into account in specifying weights. The anal)st can then adopt an appropriate method to process the information. This need may not always be the multi-attribute utility approach, or the Saaty approach, or any other specific approach, but that with which the decision-maker feels at ease.

It is concluded that Saaty's Analytic Hierarchy Process and a Simple Multi-Attributed Value Function are the approaches best suited to this problem and the most widely used in practice. The paper goes on to compare these approaches in detail from both a theoretical and a practical standpoint. The underlying assumptions of each are examined and considered in the light of practical decision aiding. The practical implications of the use of each approach are discussed. Reference is made to experimental work carried out by the author which has examined both practical and theoretical aspects of the use of each approach in isolation and in comparative studies. The paper will be of relevance to anyone facing a decision involving a finite number of alternatives and multiple criteria and considering the use of a formal approach. },

@inproceedings{Ross:2005,
	Abstract = {Over the past five years, researchers working on a number of system design projects in the Space Systems, Policy, and Architecture Research Consortium (SSPARC) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed a process of value-focused, broad tradespace exploration for the development of space systems. The broad tradespace framework has provided insights into communicating and quantifying the impact of changing requirements, uncertainty, and system properties such as flexibility and robustness. Additionally, insights have been made in applications to more complex cases, such as analyzing policy effects on system cost and performance, as well as understanding the time-dependent effects of architecture and design choices for spiral development. The tradespace exploration paradigm both broadens the perspective of designers in conceptual design to better understand the ``physics '' of the proposed solutions relative to one another, and focuses the designer on delivering systems of value to key system stakeholders.},
