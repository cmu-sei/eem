//translate the FDA powerpoint roadmap into a DSL

Roadmap is the top element. It consists of goals, stakeholders and options.

Goals determine objectives (the why) and are affected by constraints.

Stakeholders are either participants or consultants. Participants can have preferences.
Preferences are held by participants and expressed over two options (pref(optA, optB)) where the first one is preferred to the second.

Options have attributes including time, cost, schedule, cost of delay.
Each task has a set of milestones and set of response measures.

Decision points aggregate options. Once a decision is taken, the set of options is narrowed to a task.





Target (tech) architecture ultimately implements the decisions
Scenarios/use cases guide analysis and outline value proposition/testing.
Arch principles outline high level objectives
